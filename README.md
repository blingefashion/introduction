# introduction
Founded in July 2015, BLINGE is a clothing rental website that allows its customers to access Branded and designer clothes without actually having to purchase them. Founded by Pooja Dubey, Shikhar Khanna and Shashwat Gopal, it aims to solve the age old problem of girls/women of not having anything to wear for particular occasions even after having overflowing wardrobes. 

Women who can afford designer clothes tend to spend a fortune on them and end up wearing them just once o twice and the ones who aren't able to afford them end up settling for cheap alternatives or simply not the right outfit for the right occasion. BLINGE aspires to be the middle ground for women from all economic brackets.
Within a couple of months of its launch, BLINGE has found a niche' market for itself. Currently serving in Mumbai, with it 4X expansion plan in the next 6 months, it plans to expand itself to Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Chandigarh and Ahmedabad.
